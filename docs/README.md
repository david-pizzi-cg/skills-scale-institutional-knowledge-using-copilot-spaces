# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's comprehensive project management process documentation. This guide outlines our customer-first, iterative approach to delivering high-quality software projects through clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety.

OctoAcme follows a structured project lifecycle encompassing five key phases: **Initiation** (problem validation and stakeholder alignment), **Planning** (scope definition and backlog creation), **Execution** (iterative development with GitHub project boards and PR/CI gating), **Release** (deployment with quality controls), and **Retrospective** (continuous improvement). Our approach emphasizes small, testable increments delivered through well-defined workflows that include automated testing, security scanning, and release checklists with rollback plans to ensure reliability and risk mitigation.

Cross-functional teams operate with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. **Project Managers (PM)** coordinate delivery, manage schedules and risks, and facilitate communication. **Product Managers (PdM)** define outcomes, prioritize backlogs, and measure success metrics. **Developers** implement features while collaborating on design and maintaining high test coverage. **QA/Testing** teams validate quality and acceptance criteria through unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. **Stakeholders** provide essential inputs and approvals throughout the process. This collaborative structure ensures accountability while maintaining the flexibility needed for iterative delivery.

Our communication strategy maintains transparency and alignment through regular touchpoints: daily standups focus on progress and blockers, weekly PM/PdM syncs align on priorities and dependencies, sprint demos showcase progress to stakeholders, and monthly updates keep leadership informed. Escalation paths are clearly defined, moving from team-level triage to PM coordination to Product Lead and Sponsor involvement as needed. Quality assurance is embedded throughout with comprehensive testing strategies, automated security scans, and release controls that include backup procedures and incident response playbooks. Retrospectives capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements that feed back into our project backlog, ensuring continuous enhancement of our processes and outcomes.
